This module focuses on a machine learning concept known as unsupervised learning. With unsupervised learning, algorithms use test data to build models that categorize the relationships among data points. For example, when you review an item for purchase on a website, unsupervised learning algorithms might identify related items that people frequently purchase together.

Python package used: scikit-learn.
